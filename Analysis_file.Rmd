## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{R}
temp <- tempdir()
data <- file.path(temp, "Cyberpunk-2077-steam-reviews-as-of-aug-8-2024.zip")
unzip <- file.path(temp, "unzip")
dir.create(data, showWarnings = FALSE)

kaggle <- paste0(
  "kaggle datasets download -d filas1212/cyberpunk-2077-steam-reviews-as-of-aug-8-2024 ",
  "--path \"", temp, "\""
)
system(kaggle)
unzip(zipfile = data, exdir = unzip)
list.files(unzip)
```

## Import Necessary Library
```{R}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{R}
df <- read_csv("")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
